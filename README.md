Random Forest
Random forest is a tree-based algorithm which involves building several trees ( decision trees ), then combining their output to improve generalization ability of the model. So, Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.
Random forest can be used for both classification and regression problems.
